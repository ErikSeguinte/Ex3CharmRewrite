{Essence 2, Snake 4, Snake Form}
This charm supplements a decisive Snake attack with one of the following benefits:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Blinding Fang Strike (3i): If she hits, her enemy suffers a -3 penalty on all actions and is blinded for the rest of the scene. He may spend an unflurable miscellaneous action to remove these penalties.
  \item Nerve-Deadening Venom (4i): If she hits, one of the victims arms is paralized for the rest of the scene, and he suffers a -2 penalty on all actions that would normally require the use of both hands.
  \item Withering Venom Paralysis (6i): If she hits, her enemy's lower body is paralzied until the end of the scene, knocking him prone. Even if he succeeds on a Rise from Prone action he can only crawl, treating all terrain as difficult and taking a -3 penalty on movement actions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Terrestrial}: The marital artist cannot use Withering Venom Paralysis.

\charm{Uncoiling Serpent Prana}
{7m, 3i}
{Supplemental}{Instant}{Advantage}
{Essence 3, Snake 4, Snake Strikes the Heel, Armor-Penetrating Fang Strike}
This charm supplements any Snake attack while the martial artist is in Snake Form, allowing her to strike at up to Medium range using a serpentine ribbon of essence. If the attack deals 5+ Initiative damage or any decisive damage, she may drag her enemy into Close range.

\textbf{Terrestrial}: The martial artist may only make this attack at Short range rather than medium.

\textbf{Mastery}: The martial artist does not need to be in Snake Form to use this charm.

\charm{Countless Coils Evasion}
{7m, 1wp}
{Supplemental}{Instant}{Perilous, Post-Roll}
{Essence 3, Snake 5, Snake Strikes the Heel, Crippling Pressure-Point Strike}
This charm supplements the martial artist's defense against a decisive attack, after it rolls damage. She rolls (Essence + Initiative), and each success negates one level of damage from the attack. She resets to base initiative, and if she negated all the damage, gains 2i.

\textbf{Terrestrial}: The martial artist must decide to use this charm before damage is rolled (but still rolls and applies the effects after damage).
